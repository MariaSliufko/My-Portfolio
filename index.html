          <h2>Hello</h2>
          <p class="intro">Welcome to my page, I hope you will like it!
            <br>
            The choice to pursue a career in development came from wanting a change and so I gathered all my favorite things from my work experience and put it together. That lead me on the path towards becoming a developer. I'll explain this a bit better in the section below.
            So why fullstack you might ask? Well, as a mother of two I am used to juggling everything and doing it efficiently. I enjoy being involved in the creation from start to finish and it excites me to be in a field that is constantly, and rapidly, changing meaning I'll always have to be alert and keep up with the newest.

            <h3>Backend</h3>
            <p> This is where my problem-solving skills thrive. It does not give me the same instant gratification as frontend but when you're stuck on a problem for hours, or even days, what a feeling when everything falls into place. I know my fellow developers know exactly what I mean.</p>

            <h3>Frontend</h3>
            <p>This is where my eye for details really shines through, and my creative side gets put to work. I adore seeing my vision come together and being able to present it in a way everyone can enjoy it. </p>
